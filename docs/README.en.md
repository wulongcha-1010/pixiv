## ❓ FAQ

### How to obtain a RefreshToken?

Refer to the tutorial: [https://www.nanoka.top/posts/e78ef86/](https://www.nanoka.top/posts/e78ef86/)

### API quota exceeded or rate limited

* Switch to another API instance in settings
* Log in using RefreshToken or OAuth

### Images load very slowly

* Switch to another image proxy in settings
* Enable pximg direct access mode (requires a good network environment)
* Download and use the client version

### Some works are not accessible with US/UK IPs

Refer to Pixiv official announcement: [https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=10837](https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=10837)

Recommendations:

1. Log in with your own account
2. Set your region to a non-US/UK region in Pixiv web [settings](https://www.pixiv.net/setting_user.php) (Japan recommended)

### Cookie / SessionID login errors

It is recommended to use RefreshToken login, which is more stable and reliable.

### Mismatched or duplicated images in lists and details, or search results do not match search tags

This is caused by CDN caching of self-hosted APIs. Solutions:

* Switch to another API instance
* Use after logging in

### “Page not found”, “No permission to view this work”, or “Your access has been restricted”

This usually means the work has been deleted or hidden by the author.

### Android version crashes when clicking download

* Grant storage permissions in system settings
* Update to the latest version and try again

### How to install the iOS version?

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/releases)

Note: The iOS version is unsigned and requires manual signing and sideloading:

* [AltStore](https://altstore.io/)

### How to preset image proxies and API instances for self-hosted deployment?

Refer to discussions:

* [#10](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/discussions/10)
* [#13](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/discussions/13)
